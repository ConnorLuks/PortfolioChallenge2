Advanced CSS challenge: Create a Portfolio

For the challenge/homework I used HTML and CSS to create a basic portfolio using just front-end, I will add JS later on and fill out the projects that I have completed when I finished them. Note that at the moment most of the projects are placeholders. along with my contact links, currently only the GitHub link is active.

* My portfolio is broken up into sections, starting with my About Me, My Projects, and my Contact Information.

* I have mainly placeholders at the moment, but they will be filled in with proper working links once I have completed more projects.

* I will include a resume PDF once I am closer to the end of the course.

* I (attempted) to apply styleing for multiple sized screens such as tablets and smartphones. I will work on better implementation as I figure out what the current issues are.

* I applied a few hover effects to make the site more reactive, despite currently not having any JavaScript coded for it.

* Licenses used, MIT.
